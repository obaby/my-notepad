EXE2DPR - Delphi project sources Rescuer. Version 3.1 (23/09/99)
================================================================

Overview
--------
If you lose your Delphi 1.0-4.0 or C++Builder 3.0 project sources, but 
have an executable file, then this tool can rescue part of lost sources.

Rescuer produces all project forms and data modules with all assigned
properties and events. Produced event procedures don't have a body (it is
not a decompiler), but have an address of code in executable file.

For C++Builder executables Rescuer make Delphi-compatible sources.

In most cases, I think, Rescuer saves 50-90% of your time to projects
reconstruction.


Usage notes
-----------
Use command line 'exe2dpr [-o] exeFile'. Project sources will be created
in current directory. If you want overwrite any existing files in current
directory, then use option '-o'.

You can't to process files, that is not 'runnable', ie if unavailable any
dll or dpl, that this file used.
