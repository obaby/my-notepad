<B>Intro</B>
<BR><BR>
Well, this tut is REALLY basic, just to get you familiar with Dede.
I will show you how to patch the program to get it insantly registered,
and how to create a key generator.
<BR><BR>
<B>Tools</B><BR><BR>
Hmmm... i dunno. maybe dede? :)
then goes Hiew, and Delphi for coding the KeyGen<BR><BR>

<B>Files</B><BR><BR>

I included a test executable for cracking. It was written by me in a few 
seconds espesially for this tutorial.<BR>
<H5>Note by xavier : you can find the file <A HREF="/dede/files/test.zip">here</A></H5> 

* For parching jump to the last section of this file...<BR><BR>

<B>Let's get busy!</B><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>1. Start Dede.
<LI>2. Open File, and Click Process.
<LI>3. Program Will be ran. Get familiar with it(type name&company and try reg button)
<LI>4. Press Ok button ok Dede's loader
<LI>5. Goto procedures Tab in Dede
<LI>6. Select Form1 and Button1Click, that's where it's obviously will happen.
<LI>7. Start browsing the code, till you come across these:
* Possible reference to control 'Edit2':TEdit<BR>
and later on:<BR>
* Possible reference to control 'Edit1':TEdit<BR>
These shows you that program requested the .Text values of our Name/Company fields.
<LI>8. Then look for following:
</UL>
<PRE>* Reference to: System..LStrCat3()
|
0044437D   E82AF8FBFF             call    00403BAC
00444382   8D55F0                 lea     edx, [ebp-$10]

This means that both strings were Cat (appened) to a new one.
9. Next you'll see that edit3.text value is requested too. interesting, huh? :)
00444390   8B55F0                 mov     edx, [ebp-$10]
00444393   8B45FC                 mov     eax, [ebp-$04]

* Reference to: System..LStrCmp()
|
00444396   E8D5F8FBFF             call    00403C70
0044439B   7407                   jz      004443A4</PRE>
<PRE>uhuh. Weeeell. This means, that edx and eax compared, e.g. the Cat value of first two
with serial num. Could it be that simple? let's see...
if we'll browse thru this call:
0044439B   7407                   jz      004443A4
By using Disassemble fature in Dede with 004443A4 RVA,
we'll only realize that if the strings were equal, then the program will do just 
about nothing, it'll compare true with true and false with false ;)
So, we'll keep on browsing;

10. 0044439F   E85C010000             call    00444500
I have a cousy feeling about this one :) let's go into it and check!
The begining of the function is similar to the one we disscussed, it takes to
values and appends them.
What now?
00444550   E87FFEFFFF             call    004443D4
this is a procedure... what it does?
|           or: System..LStrLen()
004443F8   E863F7FBFF             call    00403B60
takes a length of a original string...
004443FF   83FB0A                 cmp     ebx, +$0A
00444402   7F12                   jnle    00444416
and creates a loop until $0A, which is 10 in decimal.
So it is equal to "for i:=length(s) to 10"
Oki. Now what do we do inside the loop?

* Reference to: System..LStrCat()
We add an 'A' character to the end of a string.

What is the conclusion? The procedure takes a string, and if it's smaller than
10 chars, it fills the ending of the string with 'A' chars.

11. Press the back button, and go to the next line:
* Possible String Reference to: "123-"
|
00444555   683C464400             push    $0044463C
oki. we same a '123-' value. good.
now browse on. you'll see that some strings are created using this procedure:
 a)LStrCopy(something,from,to)
 b)store result
 c)pass result to function at 00444444

12. let's analize the (a) part:
0044455E   B905000000             mov     ecx, $00000005
00444563   BA01000000             mov     edx, $00000001
because function parameters go in reverse order, this means that it takes the
eax value, copies from $1 to $5. so if string was 'aaabbbccc' it'll result 'aaabb';

now for the second occuranse of (a):
00444587   B904000000             mov     ecx, $00000004
0044458C   BA05000000             mov     edx, $00000005
the same crap, now from position 5, 4 chars. so the result would be: 'bbbc'

13. between this two calls, you saw a 
* Possible String Reference to: "-321-"
|
0044457E   684C464400             push    $0044464C
remember it, it'll go in the middle.
* Possible String Reference to: "-123"
|
004445A7   685C464400             push    $0044465C
and another one in the end.
So, now we know the structure of the serial: 123-xxx-321-xxx-123

14. now let's find those xxx values, by sneaking into that 00444444 call.
once more:
* Possible String Reference to: "zZz"
saved at the begining and at the end,
then:
00444488   BA03000000             mov     edx, $00000003
* Reference to: System..LStrCatN()
it takes the third charachter from the string and copies it in this way:
zZz + char + zZz
then, we see that in the same manner, it takes the first and seccond chars and
adds the to the begining and the end.
So if we had a 'Hello' string, the result would be:
'HzZzlzZze'
cool.

15. now that's about it!
now, just let's go thru the tutorial and build our own serial!
Name: Ful Company:gore 
a)Temp String: Fulgore
b)After length pumping we get: FulgoreAAA
c)now we pass the string to first copy routine and get 'Fulgo', we pass it to 
  the second function and get uzZzlzZzF
d)now we pass the string to second copy routine and get 'oreA', we pass it to 
  the second function and get rzZzezZzo
e) now we add 'em all and get: 123-FzZzlzZzu-321-ozZzezZzr-123

f) let's run and check it: tada!!!

g) use this two functions:
1st:

procedure prepare(var s:string);
var z:string; i:integer;
begin
z:=s;
for i:=length(z) to 10 do
 s:=s+'A';
end;

2nd

function Cripple(s:String):string;
var kk:string;
begin
kk:='zZz'+s[3]+'zZz';
kk:=s[1]+kk+s[2];
result:=kk;
end;

3rd.

function generate(name,comp:string):string;
var temp:string;
begin
temp:=name+comp;
prepare(temp);
result:='123-'+cripple(copy(temp,1,5))+'-321'+cripple(copy(temp,5,4))+'-123';
end;
</PRE>
<BR><BR>
<B>Patching</B><BR><BR>

<PRE>Well, this is really simple, in the Button1Click, just run to
that call    00444500 and enter it... Browse until you come across:

004445D2   740C                   jz      004445E0
* Possible String Reference to: "screw you!"
004445D4   B86C464400             mov     eax, $0044466C
* Reference to: Dialogs.ShowMessage(System.AnsiString)
004445D9   E896F9FFFF             call    00443F74
004445DE   EB0A                   jmp     004445EA
* Possible String Reference to: "good for you!"

and now it's obviouse that all you need is to change jz to jmp.
goto RVA converter in Dede and get the real offset: 000439D2
open hiew, goto hex mode, press F5 and goto 000439D2;
it will appear as JE opcode there... fix it to JMP, save and run.
voila! it worked ;)
Now fix it back, and read the keygen essay :)</PRE>

<BR><BR>
<B>Closing words:</B><BR><BR>

Thanks for reading this junk, i hope you learned atleast ANYTHING from it ;)<BR>
Bigest thanx to DaFixer for his great software, and to Borland for the 
best RAD ever.<BR><BR>

and to you for reading !<BR><BR>
