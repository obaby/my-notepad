<p><b>UPGRADE POLICY</b></p>
<p>We are constantly improving PE Explorer. One part of this improvement is to 
  add new features to the software and to improve existing features significantly. 
  The second - not less important - part is fixing bugs in the current release. 
</p>
<p>We at Heaventools commit ourselves to provide you with the best possible product. 
  Therefore we will provide you with bug fixing and minor feature improvement 
  releases (updates) for your licensed copy of PE Explorer <b>free of charge</b>. 
  For releases with major improvements (upgrades) registered users will have the 
  possibility of purchasing licenses for lowered license fees. Registration may 
  also entitle you to discounts on new software releases from Heaventools.</p>
<p>To make sure that nobody will have to worry about having to spend money upgrading only one or two months after purchasing PE Explorer, all customers who have bought v.1.xx licenses after January 20th, 2003 are entitled to free upgrades to PE Explorer version 2.00 when it is released.</p>
<p><b>Order today - your license for v1.97 will be valid for all future versions 2.xx of the product. 
  You will never be charged for minor updates! </b></p>
