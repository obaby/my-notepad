   materials ("SOFTWARE"). The term "SOFTWARE" also shall include any 
   upgrades, modified versions or updates of the Software licensed to you 
   by Heaventools. By installing and/or using the enclosed, attached, or 
   about-to-be-installed SOFTWARE you are agreeing to be bound by the terms 
   of this End User License Agreement. You assume responsibility for the 
   selection of the SOFTWARE to achieve your intended results, and for the 
   installation, use and result obtained from the SOFTWARE. Do not use the 
   SOFTWARE in any case where significant damage or injury to persons, 
   property or business may happen if an error occurs. If you do not agree

  1. LICENSE GRANT.

    Heaventools grants to you a nonexclusive license to use one copy 
    of the version of this SOFTWARE on any one hardware product for as 
    many licenses as you purchase. "You" means the company, entity or 
    individual whose funds are used to pay the license fee. "Use" means 
    storing, loading, installing, executing or displaying the SOFTWARE. 
    If you install the SOFTWARE onto a multi-user platform or network, 
    each and every individual user of the SOFTWARE must be licensed
    separately or be covered by a site license.
    You may not modify the SOFTWARE or disable any licensing or
    control features of the SOFTWARE except as an intended part of
    the SOFTWARE's programming features. When you first obtain a copy
    of the SOFTWARE, you are granted an evaluation period of not more
    than 30 days, after which time you must pay for the SOFTWARE
    according to the terms and prices discussed in the SOFTWARE's
    documentation, or you must remove the SOFTWARE from your computer.
    This license is not transferable to any other hardware product or
    other company, entity, or individual. You are expected to use the
    SOFTWARE on your system and to thoroughly evaluate its usefulness
    and functionality before making a purchase.
    This "try before you buy" approach is the ultimate guarantee that
    the SOFTWARE will perform to your satisfaction.

    Any use of the SOFTWARE which is illegal under international or
    local law is forbidden by this licence. Any such action is the sole
    responsibility of the person committing the action.

  2. OWNERSHIP.

    The SOFTWARE is owned and copyrighted by Heaventools Software.
    Your license confers no title or ownership in the SOFTWARE and

    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
    PARTY RIGHTS. NEITHER HEAVENTOOLS NOR ANYONE ELSE WHO
    HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, OR

    DAMAGES OR CLAIMS. THE PERSON USING THE SOFTWARE BEARS
    ALL RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
    RESPECT, YOU AND NOT HEAVENTOOLS OR ITS SUPPLIERS ASSUME
    THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR.

    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION
    OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
    LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE
    EXTENT THAT LIABILITY IS BY LAW INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION OR
    RESTRICTION.

    IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE
    LICENSE FEE PAID TO HEAVENTOOLS.

  6. SEVERABILITY. 

    Any term or provision of this Agreement held to be illegal or 
    unenforceable shall, if possible, be interpreted so as to be construed 
    as valid, but in any event the validity or enforceability of the 
    remainder hereof shall not be affected.

  7. NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. 

    IN NO EVENT SHALL HEAVENTOOLS OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE
    TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE DELIVERY,
    PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF HEAVENTOOLS
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO
    EVENT WILL HEAVENTOOLS' LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED
    THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU, IF ANY. HEAVENTOOLS SHALL HAVE
    NO OBLIGATION TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF
    INFRINGEMENT BASED UPON YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN 
    COMBINATION, OPERATION OR OTHERWISE WITH THE DATA OR
    MATERIALS NOT SUPPLIED BY HEAVENTOOLS.

  8. TERMINATION.

    herein. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE
    and documentation.

  9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

    This is the entire agreement between you and Heaventools which
    supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, whether written or
    oral, relating to the subject matter of this license.

 10. RESERVED RIGHTS.

    All rights not expressly granted here are reserved to Heaventools
    and/or the respective authors (listed either in the documentation
    or within the SOFTWARE).

    Heaventools reserves the right to make exceptions to any of these
    conditions, or alter these conditions, at any time. However, you
    may always use these conditions instead of any altered version if
    you prefer (note that this licence explicitly applies only to one
    version of the program; therefore, if Heaventools makes new
    conditions in connection with a future version, you do not then have
    the right to apply these conditions to that version instead).
