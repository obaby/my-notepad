Unicode Bugs:
=============

In Positionn Manager window:
  There is ListView with caption "Properties" (0011). This can't
  be translated to unicode languages (chinese) because this control
  doesn't suport unicode strings. You can keep it untranslated.

In List of Objects window:
  There is standard TreeView which doesn't suport unicode strings so it's
  not able display unicode strings

Main window:
  ToolBar tooltips doesn't suport unicode strings,
  When you right click with Mouse and try use Option "Search:"
  you will be failed in Unicode countries, because it calculates
  wrong word under cursor.

If P32Dasm display your language it doesn't mean that it also support your 
language (displaying objects from executable ...)


Setting font charset for objects used in P32Dasm (labels, objects)
==================================================================
In each language file change in section [Strings] charset constant to your that
you use (if not presented just add it), example:

[Strings]
0000=238
